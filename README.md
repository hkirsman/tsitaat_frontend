# Tsitaat.com Front React

## Todo

1. Refactor styles and markup.
2. Remove HTML from json and write logic into frontend. That said, remove dangerouslySetInnerHTML
3. Decrease the json payload - probably would need to change to Apollo as it only sends data
   that is needed. /tsitaatcom_json/top-100-quotes currently is 316kb.
