# Tsitaat.com Front React

## Todo

1. Many resources are still pulled from current production - search for www.tsitaat.com
1. Refactor styles and markup.
1. Remove HTML from json and write logic into frontend. That said, remove dangerouslySetInnerHTML
1. Decrease the json payload - probably would need to change to Apollo as it only sends data
   that is needed. /tsitaatcom_json/top-100-quotes currently is 316kb.
1. How to set global variables for example for http://tsitaat.com.lndo.site/tsitaatcom_json
1. How to fix pages/quotes/authors.js
1. 404 page is too big, just decrease height a bit would be enough for now.
1. Get rid of frontend/lib/isAuthorPage.js & frontend/lib/isAuthorListingPage.js etc.
   Was not able to use class functions inside getInitialProps().
1. Although currently there's also http://www.tsitaat.com/latest-quotes we should translate it.
